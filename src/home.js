  <h2> why representation matters..</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.dropingaming.com/2021/05/18/the-importance-of-representation-in-video-games/">"Representation</a> is being able to see people similar to yourself in the environment you surround yourself in. This affirms our sense of identity, makes us feel like we belong, and is an essential element of being able to feel confident and happy."</p>
<p>Representation in media has grown throughout the years, but the video game industry has a long way to go. <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2020/lgbtq-gamers-are-an-untapped-demographic/">LGBTQ+ households are 25% more likely</a> to have a gaming console in their house, but how many games are they able to see themselves in? <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/10-times-games-got-diversity-right-and-10-they-really-didnt/">80% of video game characters are white men,</a> unless it’s the main character then it’s 85%.</p>
<p>In our research alone, we found that minorities are represented in very few ways. 1: stereotypes, but I’m sure you’re not surprised by this one. 2: Side characters. 3: player character customization choice. We did our best to not include games that have these forms of representation, because, does it really count? You’re able to make your character in Fallout 4 be black, <a href="https://techtalk.currys.co.uk/tv-gaming/gaming/diversity-in-gaming/ethnicity-in-games.html">but the default for both genders is white</a>. Games like the Sims or Stardew Valley appeared in our searches, but is it really representation if you have to create the character yourself?</p>
<p>As for queer characters, most of the games we found, similarly to above, you had the <span>option</span> to play your character as queer. Deciding to romance Shaundi in Saints Row while playing your created player character as a woman isn’t exactly what we’re asking for. The most popular form of representation was dating sims or visual novels, which in some cases is still only a choice if you will be taking part in queer stories.</p>
<p>Despite all of this, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/">33% of gamers do not believe there is an issue with representation in gaming</a>, a very small 9% do, and the rest have no opinion. To that I say, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/99574-we-must-take-sides-neutrality-helps-the-oppressor-never-the">Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim.</a></p>

  <h2> what representation means to me..</h2>
    <p>
    "So it"s hard for me to describe how I feel about my own representation in video games. It"s a weird sort of apathy? There is no south asian representation in video games and very little in Western entertainment culture at all. It"s not even disappointment as much as it"s just normal, which is pretty sad to think about." - <span>Eesha (21) </span>
